Learning the Go language... Play/share area with friends

# My approach
A lot of programming or scripting languages I jump into immediately trying to just transfer my experience with other programming languages directly into them and doing "on the fly" transcoding and translation. If that language isn't going to be my "daily driver" that's great and works.

But...

When I apporach a new programming language that I may end up making a mainstay, I begin learning it like I've never programmed before. I want to know the way programs in that language are structured, intrinsic types and how you declare a variable, control structures, how you handle an error, memory access, what does a function look like, etc.

While this doesn't benefit everyone, I like to know how the soil smells before I plant a seed in it. How the metals behave before I forge a tool. How the wood reacts before I cut or sand it. I read the forward and intros to all my texts books in college too. ;-)

Then I get friends to challenge my notions of the language. I've been fortunate to have a lot of friends who are much smarter than me. So, if I can defend my reasons for focusing on that language as a career choice, I'm probably not wasting my time.
